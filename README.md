# 👋 Hi, I’m Diogo Passos!

I'm a **former professional musician and arts educator** now embracing the world of **software development**. After over a decade directing a music school and performing across the globe, I discovered a new passion: building digital solutions that solve real-world problems.

🎯 Currently focused on:
- **Backend development** with Java and RESTful APIs
- **Fullstack web apps** with React.js
- Writing clean, maintainable and tested code
- Learning DevOps and cloud infrastructure (Terraform, Docker)

💼 My recent projects include:
- A **gym management system** with authentication, role-based access and real-time chat
- An **e-commerce platform** inspired by OLX/Vinted with search, payments, and seller profiles
- A system for managing **employee evaluations** in training institutions

🧰 **Tech stack:**
- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks:** React.js, Node.js
- **Tools:** Git, REST APIs, WebSockets, JUnit
- **Other:** internationalization (i18n)
